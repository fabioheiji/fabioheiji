Hi guys!

🤓 My name is Fábio and I'm passionate about:
- Analytics
- Artificial Intelligence
- Programming

👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently studying System of Information in University of Sao Paulo Brazil but I've been a Supply Chain consultant for 10+ years. In the consultancy I'm expert in Supply Chain, Logistic, Forecast and Simulation. That's where my passion for programming, technology and AI awoke. I'm currently looking for a career change to the programming area, specifically in data sciences...Wish me luck! 🤞

So, most of my repositories would have:
- Python
- Java
- HTML, JS and CSS are still in the learning phase...

☝️ And, feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

🤩 Currelty, I'm trying to populate my repositories with interesting projects...
